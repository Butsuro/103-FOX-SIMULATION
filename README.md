If you would like to run the code yourself:
you must clone or download the repository and run the main.py file

if there are any additional variables that you would like to modify like the number of traps,
 that can be modified at the initializer.py file

any additional capture info for the progress and proccesing stage the file is on can be seen in the terminal

We recomend running the simulation multiple times for the most accurate results
